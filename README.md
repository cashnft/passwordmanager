This Python project aims to create a local password manager, ensuring the security of stored credentials. The manager will use encryption techniques to save both the master password and other stored passwords.

Features
1. Master Password Encryption: The master password is securely encrypted(SHA256 encryption)
   
2. Password Storage: All user passwords are stored in an encrypted form.

3. User friendly Interface: The system provides an interface for adding, retrieving, and managing passwords.

Encryption
The project utilizes SHA-256, a complex hashing function, to protect the sensitive information. This ensures that even if unauthorized access occurs the stored passwords remain secure.

Interface
The password manager will feature a simple console based interface. The user can navigate to the different options and add and receive passwords easily.
